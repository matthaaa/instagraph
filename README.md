Preview it [here](https://instagraph-aa.herokuapp.com/#/)!

Instagraph is designed to be a clone of [Instagram](https://instagram.com) with additional features and functionality. This clone is built with a Ruby on Rails backend and a React/Flux frontend, with a PostgreSQL database.

## Main Features

### Photo Feed and View

The home page includes a reverse-chronological feed of posts by all users.
Users have their own profiles with a collection of their uploaded photo posts. 
Photo posts can be viewed both on the home page and on a module on the user profile page.

### Post Interactions

Users can upload photo posts with caption descriptions that appear on their profile pages and the home feed. Each user can add and remove comments on any post, which appear chronologically beneath each photo post. and "like" and "unlike" posts as well, indicated by an icon beneath the photo.

### User Profiles

Each individual user has a profile page with their photos appearing on a grid. On this page users can choose to follow other users. The followers, followees, and post counts are all displayed on this user profile page.

### User Interactions

Users can follow each other, which will later be used for conditional logic (showing items on the feed, accessing private accounts, etc).
